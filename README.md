# On Time Deliver KPI

### 1. Introduction
In 2020, my company failed 1 of their 19 Operational KPI. Fortunately we met the rest of it, which save us some trouble. But what if we had failed another one? You can be sure that penalties would have been applied... <br/>
Let's take a deeper look at what caused the "On Time Delivery" KPI to fail, so we can take concrete actions and meet the target this year.

### 2. Problem statement
Every shipment sent to a consignee is recorded in our system, alongside with a "REMARKS" column indicating what was the reason of delay, if any. We will go through the delayed shipment and analyzed the different justifications.

### 3. Reading the data
The KPI data is clustered by month. We need to load every sheet corresponding to each month and then combine them into 1 dataframe.
